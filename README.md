## About
URLI can help you increment URLs. For example, if the URL has a "page=1" in it or if there's a Next link on the page, URLI can get you to "page=2" in a variety of ways.

## Notes
- Mapping shortcut keys to mouse buttons with 3rd party apps like Logitech Gaming Software is not supported and may only work if you use Logitech's "Multikey Macro" option.
- Download Incrementing is an optional and experimental feature that is designed to be used with Auto so you can have a unique Multiple Page Downloader (think a simple "Down them all" that can run automatically!). It uses a custom-built downloader that I've developed for URLI.
- URLI's Toolkit is a toolkit I made to help me develop and test URLI, but I've "unlocked" for you to use as a non-standard feature!
- Saving URLs is completely optional.
- Firefox only: Local file:// URLs may not increment due to a bug in Firefox (Bug 1266960).
- Firefox only: URLI's Popup may not work in Private Windows due to the different way Firefox decided to handle this in respect to Chrome (Bug 1329304).
- Firefox only: Firefox 60 (non ESR) Users won't be able to grant Download permissions on the Options page due to a bug in Firefox 60 (Bug 1382953); please update to Firefox 61 or higher.

## Permissions Justification
Chrome/Edge: URL Incrementer requires no special permissions.

Firefox: URL Incrementer requires the `all_urls` permission in order to offer Internal Shortcuts because Firefox does not support the chrome.declarativeContent API to make this an optional feature that sticks like in Chrome/Edge.

Some optional features require extra permissions:
1. Internal Shortcuts - requires the `all_urls` Permission
2. Enhanced Mode - requires the `all_urls` Permission
3. Download - requires the Download Permission and `all_urls` Permission
